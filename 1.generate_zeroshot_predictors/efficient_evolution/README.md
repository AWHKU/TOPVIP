# Generate ESM2 scores
We calculate the ESM2 scores based on the the scripts provided in [efficient-evolution](https://github.com/brianhie/efficient-evolution.git). 

To run the python script, follow the instructions in the efficient-evolution github to install the environment and download the ESM models. 


The input and output data are available in **data/zeroshot_prediction/efficient_evoluation_BH**.
